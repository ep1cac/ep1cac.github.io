Hello and welcome to my blog! Here you will my writeups for some of the CTFs I've done. I've started with a few interesting challenges I've done in the past, but as time goes on, I'll populate this site with writeups for newer CTFs as well.

### Whoami

A bit about myself... I'm a CompSci undergrad trying to learn how to properly secure his stuff. I'm also OSCP-certified and like to spend my free time learning more about security through CTFs, mostly TryHackMe and HackTheBox in the past, but also expanding onto other platforms like Portswigger and Pwned Labs. If anybody has other recommendations, questions, or would like to connect, here is my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/qihan-w-291838222/). You can also find some of my projects on [Github](https://github.com/Ep1cac).
